IBM train homework

I worked under the assumption of a limited defined route
Graph: AB5, BC4, CD8, DC8, DE6, AD5, CE2, EB3, AE7.

This design focuses on a liner time complexity capable 
of a liner growth rate.

The user should be aware of the routes but even if you
don't the user worry you can try as many times as you want.

You will be asked after every try to afrim if you wish to
give another try.
